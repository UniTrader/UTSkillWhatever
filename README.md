This Mod makes use of the Skills the Player has (like all other Entities) - you start with 0 Skill Points in every aspect and will improve them with certain NPC Interactions, currently:
=> Hiring someone (1 Skill point more)
=> Smalltalk with Hireable NPCs (depending how you perform up to 3 Skill points more - 1 for regular smalltalk without mistakes, 1 for hard smalltalk without mistakes and 1 for very good hard smalltalk with a slight mistake)
-> more suggestions welcome ;)
the Skill which is improved depends on the NPC you interacted with - it will always be one of his relevant Skills :)
When you gained a Star your current Skills will be displayed in the Info Window on the top right ;)
Your Total Skill is currently capped at 25 Stars - you cannt get more, but you can re-distribute them when you reached this cap by performing the aforementioned actions (for every Star gained another will be lost ;) )

when your Skill is the same or higher than the potential employees (only the relevant ones) you will know his Skills immediately when you speak to him personally. More Ideas what could be done with this welcome ;)

this Mod does not require any Text Files or Translations - all Text is taken from the Game itself (except for the content.xml) ;)
